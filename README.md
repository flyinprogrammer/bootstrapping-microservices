# Bootstrapping Microservices

This repo is my scratch pad for the book [Bootstrapping Microservices with Docker, Kubernetes, and Terraform](https://www.manning.com/books/bootstrapping-microservices-with-docker-kubernetes-and-terraform)
by [Ashley Davis](https://twitter.com/codecapers).

Here are references to the different chapter code examples:

* [Chapter 2](https://github.com/bootstrapping-microservices/chapter-2)
* [Chapter 3](https://github.com/bootstrapping-microservices/chapter-3)

## Extra Docs

I've created my own little notes in the `docs/` directory.

* [Docker without Docker](./docs/DOCKER_WITHOUT_DOCKER.md)
* [Alpine or Not](./docs/ALPINE_OR_NOT.md)
